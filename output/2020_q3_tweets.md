Different groups are searched at different rates – men aged 18-24 identifying as Black were on-average 19 times more likely to be searched than the population at large. The reasons for this are likely to be a complex mix of different factors, with no single cause.

76% of searches in July to September 2020 resulted in no further action. In the past two years, the proportion of searches, for drugs, stolen goods and weapons (based on reasonable suspicion) resulting in a formal outcome (e.g. arrest) have all decreased.

The likelihood of searches having a formal criminal-justice outcome is similar across ethnicities – over the past six months, the probability of a formal outcome to searches of Black or Asian people was not significantly different from the probabilty of a formal outcome to searches of White people for any of the main search types
